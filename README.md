abstrast:
Time Synchronized Channel Hopping (TSCH) is a low-power wireless networking solution targeted at critical industrial applications, and which offers ultra-high reliability and ultra-low power consumption.
While initially designed for 2.4 GHz IEEE802.15.4 radios, TSCH protocol stacks have been demonstrated with different technologies -- including IEEE802.15.4.g and LoRa -- to address applications with different datarate/range trade-offs.
In all cases, the radio technology is matches to the type of application, and devices use only a single radio.
In this article, we present gTiSCH, a generalization of TSCH in which each device is equipped with a multi-technology radios, and can change technology on a frame-by-frame basis.
This allows the network to dynamically adjust the datarate/range trade-off:
    communicate fast with a close neighbor,
    slow with a neighbor further away.
We integrate this concept into the 6TiSCH standard and implement it on the OpenMote-B board, using the OpenWSN reference implementation.
We use 3 technologies:
     50 kpbs 2-FSK  at 868 MHz,
    250 kbps O-QPSK at 2.4 GHz, and
    800 kpbs OFDM   at 868 MHz.
A comprehensive experimental campaign on a 80-mote testbed shows that gTiSCH outperforms a traditional single-technology 6TiSCH network, regardless of the radio technology by that radio.
we discuss the fact that modern radio chips can offer multi-technology capabilities with no increase in cost.
