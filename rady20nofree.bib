A particular interest was accorded to define a robust MAC layer for wireless sensor networks, in order to reduce interference caused by other co-located networks and applications using the ISM band. This paper gives a comprehensive study of the Time Slotted channel Hopping IEEE802.15.4, part of the 6TiSCH stack and explains how its TDMA approach improves the reliability with performance guarantees. We also investigate analytically and experimentally the impact of the scheduling algorithm on the reliability. Then, we provide an experimental evaluation of colocated WSN using the FiT-IoT LAB testbed and the OpenWSN Stack. Performance analysis of IEEE802.15.4e-TSCH is achieved with a variable number of co-located synchronized or unsynchronized instances. While this standard is robust for lightly loaded networks, new mechanisms have to be proposed when we have too much traffic or too many interfering networks.},

This allows to simultaneously run applications with different requirements on link characteristics and to increase resilience against interference. To this end, we first enable sub-GHz communication in TSCH, which has been primarily defined for the 2.4 GHz band. Thereafter, we propose two designs to support multiple physical layers in TSCH on the same nodes. Our experimental evaluation shows that TSCH is applicable in a wide range of data rates between 1.2 kbps and 1000 kbps. We find that data rates of 50 kbps and below have a long communication range and a nearly perfect link symmetry, but also have a 20x higher channel utilization compared to higher data rates, increasing the risk of collisions. Using these findings, we show the advantages of the multi-band support on the example of synchronization accuracy when exchanging TSCH beacons with a low data rate and application data at a high data rate.},

  abstract = {Low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) multiradio access technology (RAT) devices promise enabling Internet of Things (IoT) use-cases that simultaneously require high coverage and data rates, and low energy consumption. For such devices, active probing is usually used for discovering if communication between a mobile terminal (MT) and a base station (BS) or a handover of the MT across LPWAN technologies should be initiated. Because of continuous probing, this procedure increases signaling overhead and energy consumption of the MT. Assuming that the location information of the MT is required for enabling an IoT use-case, this information can potentially also be used for enhancing the discovery and vertical handover procedures in heterogeneous LPWANs. Hence, we propose a location-based mechanism for making discovery and handover decisions in outdoor LPWANs. We do that under the assumption that the location of the MT can be estimated with a certain level of localization errors, while the perfectly accurate location information of the BSs are known to the MT. The mechanism grounds the decisions on the expected SNR between the MT and the BS, which removes the need for continuous probing. If the location information of the MT can be estimated with GPS-like accuracy, we demonstrate that the mechanism can achieve more than 90\% correct discovery decisions. We also show that the mechanism is highly accurate in determining if a handover between technologies should be initiated. For an order of magnitude less accurate location information (e.g., for SigFox-based fingerprinting), we show that the mechanism can still make reasonable discovery decisions.},

  abstract = {IEEE802.15.4g is a low-power wireless standard initially designed for Smart Utility Networks, i.e., for connecting smart meters. IEEE802.15.4g operates at sub-GHz frequencies to offer 2\textendash 3\texttimes{} longer communication range compared to its 2.4 GHz counterpart. Although the standard offers 3 PHYs (Frequncy Shift Keying, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing and Offset-Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) with numerous configurations, 2-FSK at 50 kbps is the mandatory and most prevalent radio setting used. This article looks at whether IEEE802.15.4g can be used to provide connectivity for outdoor deployments. We conduct range measurements using the totality of the standard (all modulations with all further parametrization) in the 863\textendash 870 MHz band, within four scenarios which we believe cover most low-power wireless outdoor applications: line of sight, smart agriculture, urban canyon, and smart metering. We show that there are radio settings that outperform the ``2-FSK at 50 kbps'' base setting in terms of range, throughput and reliability. Results show that highly reliable communications with data rates up to 800 kbps can be achieved in urban environments at 540 m between nodes, and the longest useful radio link is obtained at 779 m. We discuss how IEEE802.15.4g can be used for outdoor operation, and reduce the number of repeater nodes that need to be placed compared to a 2.4 GHz solution.},

The former has been in the IEEE802.15.4 standard since 2003, the latter was rolled into its 2015 revision. OFDM promises exceptional performance, in particular in environments with high external interference and multi-path fading. This paper starts with a comprehensive overview of IEEE802.15.4 and IEEE802.15.4g, with a particular focus on OFDM, its design drivers and modes of operation. The second half of this paper presents results from an exhaustive benchmarking campaign of both technologies in a building environment, and discusses lessons learnt. We show how OFDM has a higher range, even at 400 kbps and 800 kbps data rates. We then quantify the importance of frequency repetition in OFDM, and of using a wide communication channel, and we show how the use of OFDM can result in a 2-4\texttimes{} decrease in power consumption compared to 2.4 GHz O-QPSK. We conclude by recommending the use of OFDM option 1, with MCS2 for short ({$<$}128 B) frames, and MCS3 otherwise.},

Each TestBox in the testbed connects to an MQTT broker over WiFi, no dedicated wiring or back-end is needed.

Without any changes to the hardware or protocol stack of that product, we re-purpose Blink \textendash{} a feature designed to allow for mobile nodes \textendash{} for localization. We demonstrate how we can deploy the resulting localization solution throughout a building by installing an anchor node in each room, and locate the room a mobile tag is in. Initial results indicate that this solution offers over 90\% room-level localization accuracy, and at worst adjacent room localization. The unique aspect of it is that the entire network of anchor nodes in battery powered and operates for years on a pair of AA batteries. There are countless applications looking for easily to install and fully battery powered room-level localization, for which our solution, which is production-ready, is ideal.},

  abstract = {Industrial networks differ from others kinds of networks because they require real-time performance in order to meet strict requirements. With the rise of low-power wireless standards, the industrial applications have started to use wireless communications in order to reduce deployment and management costs. IEEE802.15.4-TSCH represents currently a promising standard relying on a strict schedule of the transmissions to provide strong guarantees. However, the radio environment still exhibits time-variable characteristics. Thus, the network has to provision sufficient resource (bandwidth) to cope with the worst case while still achieving high energy efficiency. The 6TiSCH IETF working group defines a stack to tune dynamically the TSCH schedule. In this paper, we analyze in depth the stability and the convergence of a 6TiSCH network in an indoor testbed. We identify the main causes of instabilities, and we propose solutions to address each of them. We show that our solutions improve significantly the stability.},

TSCH aims to guarantee high network reliability by exploiting channel hopping and keeping the nodes time-synchronized at the MAC layer. In this paper, we focus on the traffic isolation issue, where several clients and applications may cohabit under the same wireless infrastructure without impacting each other. To this end, we present an autonomous version of 6TiSCH where each device uses only local information to select their timeslots. Moreover, we exploit 6TiSCH tracks to guarantee flow isolation, defining the concept of shared (best-effort) and dedicated (isolated) tracks. Our thorough experimental performance evaluation campaign, conducted over the open and large scale FIT IoT-LAB testbed (by employing the OpenWSN), highlight the interest of this solution to provide reliability and low delay while not relying on any centralized component.},

The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact different types of interference produce on these modulations, in terms of the resulting PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) and depending on the length of the packet being transmitted. The results show that the SUN-OFDM physical layer provides significant benefits compared to the ubiquitous OQPSK-DSSS in terms of interference robustness, regardless of the interference type and the packet length. Overall, this demonstrates the suitability of choosing the SUN-OFDM physical layer when deploying low-power wireless networks in industrial scenarios, specially taking into consideration the possibility of trading-off robustness and spectrum efficiency depending on the application requirements.},

  abstract = {Tens of thousands of wireless industrial monitoring deployments exist today, logging more than 18 billion operating hours. These solutions have been around for over a decade and are based on standards such as WirelessHART and ISA100.11a to provide performance guarantees to the applications. The new trend in industry deployments is the convergence of operational and information technologies happening through the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm. The challenge is to bridge the performance of these well-proven industrial standards with the interoperability of IP-based systems. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the organization behind most of the technical solutions of the Internet, has produced a set of specifications with this requirement in mind. The output of this effort is the 6TiSCH protocol stack based on open standards, such as those that have played a key role in the Internet's ubiquitous adoption. The standardization of 6TiSCH is done. The state-of-the-art research work focus is on important, but niche, optimizations and performance evaluations of the 6TiSCH stack. This paper takes a different approach \textendash it evaluates the performance of the standards-compliant 6TiSCH solution from the end user point of view. It does so on two experimental testbeds, in typical IoT test scenarios based on a well-defined experimentation methodology. We provide a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) useful for the end user to decide whether the 6TiSCH technology is a good fit performance-wise for a particular use case. We demonstrate reliability of a vanilla open-source implementation of 6TiSCH above 99.99\%, upstream latency on the order of a second and radio duty cycle well below 1\%.},

In TSCH networks, time is divided into repeated chunks known as slotframes, which are further divided into timeslots. We explore the effect the number of available transmission slots has on packet end-to-end latency for an 11 slot 6TiSCH network with 1, 3, 5, 8, and 11 active slots. Results are reported for a setup with one transmitter and one receiver.},
